Key Requirments for this Assignment and how I accomplished them:
- **3+ scenes**: I split the assignment into 3 scenes like recommended. Studio scene, scene hinting a part of my game/ the world, and a menu scene. 
- **2+ audio assets**: I created all audio assets myself and used 2 in the game as different types of music. I have my introduction music and my menu music. Both composed by myself using an electric piano for one and the second audio file is a sped up version of the first.
- **2+ image assets**: I used quite a few image assets that I will list below.
Fly: https://www.pixilart.com/draw/fly-sprite-f2af8be1b31fa5b (author unknown), I changed the colors of the original fly
Beetle: https://www.pixilart.com/dedchristmas I used paint.net to remove the background
Bee: https://www.pixilart.com/mias-ur-bestie I used paint.net to remove the background
Grass Background: https://opengameart.org/content/grass-pixel-art I used paint.net to crop the image
Mountain Background: https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/empty-park-landscape-scene-with-river_13753820.htm#query=pixel%20grass&position=12&from_view=keyword&track=robertav1_2_sidr I used paint.net to resize the pixel size of the image, crop, and remove the dirt from the bottom to have less colors.
- **2+ geometric shapes**: In scene 2 I used a variety of rectangles as underlines and as a line above the main text on the screen. I used 5 rectangles as lines with the words. Also on the last scene I created a circle to look like an added sun. 
- **1+ logotype text**: The first scene is a sprite image of pixel art logotype text. I hand made this art on pixilart.
- **1+ multi-line text block**: Last scene has a multi-line text block that says PLAY, Settings, Credits, Quit... all appearing on different lines.
- **1+ fading scene transition (fading animation)**: Almost every scene has a fading in and out transition. I am using about 6 total to fade in and out. 
- **1+ object motion animation**: Scene 2 uses object motion animation with tweens to slide 3 different objects from off the screen onto the screen.
